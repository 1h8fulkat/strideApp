I built this for my own treadmill. If it's useful to you, take it somewhere I
wouldn't have.

## The most useful thing you can do

**Tell me what board your treadmill has.** Working or not.

Right now the known-good list is one machine, a NordicTrack C 1750 with a
FitPro board, and that's the single biggest thing standing between this working
on my treadmill and working on yours. I'm not buying more treadmills to find
out, so the list can only come from other people.

[`console/usbprobe`](console/usbprobe) asks your board what it is and changes
nothing. Run it and [open an issue](https://github.com/keranm/strideApp/issues)
with the result, even if the answer is "it didn't work".

Second most useful: **the install guide is unproven.** Nobody who didn't
already know the answers has followed [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) end to
end. If you get stuck, the place you got stuck is a bug in the guide. Tell me
where, or send a pull request that fixes it.

## Getting set up

You need the Android SDK and a console you can reach over ADB.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/keranm/strideApp.git
cd strideApp/console/stride
./run.sh          # builds, installs, launches, tails the log
```

`run.sh` sets `JAVA_HOME` for you. Calling `./gradlew` directly tends to fail
in a way that blames the wrong thing.

The five interfaces are plain HTML in
[`console/stride/app/src/main/assets/ui/`](console/stride/app/src/main/assets/ui/)
and each one opens standalone in a desktop browser, with a stubbed bridge and
fake data behind it. You can redesign a screen without going anywhere near a
treadmill:

```sh
open console/stride/app/src/main/assets/ui/cluster.html
```

Add `?screen=welcome`, `?screen=summary`, `?screen=paused` and so on to land
on a particular state, or press the number keys to jump between them.

## Where things live

| | |
|---|---|
| `console/stride/` | The Android app. Kotlin drives the machine, HTML draws the screen. |
| `console/usbprobe/` | Read-only board identifier. Writes nothing, moves nothing. |
| `protocol/` | The [FitPro serial protocol](protocol/FITPRO_PROTOCOL.md), decoded. Start here for a different machine. |
| `homeassistant/` | Optional coach, reminders and dashboard scripts. |
| `tools/unchain.sh` | Disables the iFit packages in the order that matters. |

## If you touch anything that moves the belt

This is the one place I'd ask you to be careful, because it's a motor with a
person standing on it.

- **The safety key is the stop of record.** It's hardware and it cuts the
  motor. Nothing in software gets to be the last line.
- **Incline is driven, speed is only ever suggested.** The user decides when to
  go faster. Auto start-up is optional and capped at 3 km/h.
- **Every request is clamped** to the range the board reports for itself, in
  Kotlin, not in the interface. A layout can't outrun the machine, and it
  should stay that way.
- **Say what you tested on.** "Built and installed, board idle, no errors" is
  worth knowing. So is "I haven't walked on this".

Read [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md) before changing anything in that area.

## Style

Nothing strict. Two habits that make the code readable:

- **Comments explain why, not what.** The tricky parts of this project are all
  "the board reports 0.00 at every speed" or "this console boots at 2010", and
  those facts are invisible from the code alone.
- **Commit messages carry the reasoning.** Look at the log for the shape.

## What I can promise

Not much. This is a side project on one treadmill and I may be slow. If you
send something and I go quiet, chase me, or fork it and carry on without me.
That's what the licence is for.
