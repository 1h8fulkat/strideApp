   STRIDE core — the part every UI shares.

   The console runs one HTML document at a time (see MainActivity: the chosen
   UI is loaded into the WebView by asset name). Each document owns its whole
   look — its own DOM, its own CSS, no shared stylesheet, because a shared
   stylesheet is how five deliberately different interfaces start leaking into
   each other. What they *do* share is everything that is not a look:

     * the 400 m track maths, which is fiddly and easy to get subtly wrong;
     * the state contract, so one Kotlin snapshot reads the same everywhere;
     * the setup flow (who / what / how / which), which is behaviour, not style;
     * touch handling, which took real tuning to feel right mid-stride.

   Loaded with a plain <script src="stride-core.js"> from a sibling file in
   assets/. That is local, not remote — the "no external resources" rule is
   about the network, and this ships inside the APK.

   Chromium 83 (2020). No optional catch binding beyond what shipped then, no
   `String.replaceAll`, no `Array.prototype.at`, no `:has()`, no `inset`.

   1. THE 400 m TRACK
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   A running track is a *stadium*, not an ellipse: two parallel straights
   closed by two exact semicircles. Position along it is closed form, so there
   is no reason to ask the browser — and two reasons not to. `getPointAtLength`
   is unreliable on this WebView and is outright broken on <rect>, and an
   ellipse approximation puts the head dot off the rail, visibly, on the bends.

   THE OBLIQUE TRAP, which is the whole reason this is one function and not
   four copies:

       Arc-length is not preserved under a non-uniform scale.

   Squash the oval first and then measure along it and the dot drifts off the
   rail — worst at the ends, where the squash bites hardest. So the ordering is
   fixed and not negotiable:

       1. walk the arc-length in TRUE track space, where the maths is clean;
       2. THEN apply the squash to the resulting point.

   The dot then stays welded to the rail, and its screen speed varies round the
   loop — quicker along the straights, slower round the ends. That is not a
   bug; that is what a foreshortened track looks like.

   The same trap catches the progress arc. `stroke-dasharray` measures the
   *drawn* path, which is the squashed one, so a dash fraction taken from true
   arc-length would not end underneath the dot. `dashFraction()` maps between
   the two through a table built once at construction.

   Geometry is a parameter, not a constant. The handoff's canonical track is
   two 248 px straights and r = 158 semicircles and that is the default, but a
   UI that draws the oval smaller passes its own numbers and gets arc-length
   along the stadium it actually drew.

   1b. THE ELEVATION PROFILE
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The guided hero in three of the four directions is the same idea: the whole
   walk drawn end to end as ground, with the part already covered picked out
   bright and a marker showing where you are on it.

   THE LINE IS THE DECK. Not an impression of it — the actual thing the motor
   is going to do, plotted against the same clock.

   This was got wrong once, in a way worth writing down. The first version drew
   a vertex at the *middle* of each segment and joined those up, which makes a
   handsome rolling landscape and is a lie: it slopes continuously while the
   deck is holding dead flat, and it agrees with the machine at exactly two
   instants per segment. Walking on it, the line rises under your marker while
   the deck does nothing, then flattens out just as the deck starts to climb.
   Reported from the belt within minutes, and quite right.

   What the deck actually does — see MainActivity.driveIncline — is hold, move,
   hold. At a segment boundary it starts stepping [INCLINE_STEP] percent every
   [INCLINE_EVERY_MS], so a flat-to-six-and-a-half change takes about twenty
   seconds, and then it sits there for the rest of the segment. So that is what
   gets drawn: a flat run, a ramp of the real duration, a flat run. Every slope
   on screen is a slope the motor is making, and every flat is a flat.

   The same arc-length trap as the track applies, for the same reason: progress
   along the *time* axis is not progress along the drawn line, because a ramp
   covers more path per second than a flat. So `dashAt` walks the real polyline
   rather than assuming the two are proportional, and the bright line ends
   underneath the marker instead of somewhere near it. The staircase makes this
   matter more, not less — the risers are nearly vertical and eat drawn length
   without eating any clock.
   =========================================================================== */

/**
 * Seconds the deck takes per percent of grade change.

     Hold, move, hold. At each segment boundary the deck starts stepping
     towards the new grade at DECK_SEC_PER_PCT per percent, and then it sits.

     Crucially it does not always get there. A segment can end before the deck
     has finished travelling — on a five-minute walk the segments are fifteen
     to thirty-five seconds and a jump to nine and a half percent needs nearly
     thirty, so the deck spends the whole walk chasing targets it never
     reaches. Drawing the plan's intent there would be drawing a hill nobody
     climbs. Each segment therefore starts from wherever the deck genuinely got
     to in the last one, and the line shows the shortfall.

     A short plan consequently looks much flatter than its template. That is
     not the drawing being timid; it is what a five-minute rolling-hills walk
     is. */

  /* ---- gradient, or the ground it describes? --------------------------
     A template's x axis is seconds and its y axis is grade: the plan is a
     shape in time, and there is no distance to integrate over until somebody
     picks a pace.

     A route is different. Its steps are metres of real ground, so the honest
     drawing is the ground — cumulative elevation — and plotting grade there
     misleads. Reported from a walk on 2026-08-07: a steady -3% drew as a flat
     line, because an unchanging gradient *is* flat on a gradient axis, and it
     read as level ground. Worse, a decline easing -3 → -2 → -1 drew as a
     rising line and looked like a climb, while the walker was still going down
     and the coach was correctly saying the decline was ending. Two readings of
     one picture, and the picture was the one that was wrong.

     Integrating settles the jaggedness too: a 1% rung is a visible step on a
     gradient axis, but on an elevation axis it is a change of slope — which is
     what a hill actually looks like. */

   2. THE STATE CONTRACT
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Kotlin pushes one flat Snapshot at 5 Hz (Session.kt: Snapshot.toJson). The
   handoff assumes something richer and nested. Rather than churn the Kotlin —
   which is the part that is proven on hardware and has no business changing
   for a repaint — the flat frame is adapted here, once, into the documented
   shape. Every UI then reads the same object and none of them re-derive laps
   or climb five separate ways.

   Two things are derived rather than received:

   * `session.climb` — metres ascended. Kotlin does not track it; integrating
     Δdistance × grade on this side is accurate enough for a number displayed
     to the nearest metre, and costs nothing.
   * `control` — casual or guided, which is simply whether a plan was resolved.

   `phase` deliberately does NOT become 'fault' when the safety key is out.
   Pulling the key is an interrupt, not a route: it preempts whatever is on
   screen, and putting the key back returns to exactly where the user was with
   the session intact. A UI reads `safetyKey` and paints over the top.
