/**
 * Speaks a coach line through the console's own speaker.
 *
 * The console has **no text-to-speech engine at all** — `tts_default_synth` is
 * null and there is not a single speech package installed — so Android's
 * `TextToSpeech` cannot be used here however much it looks like the obvious
 * answer. Home Assistant synthesises the line instead and hands over a URL to
 * the resulting mp3; this streams it.
 *
 * Two deliberate details:
 *
 * * **Plain HTTP, on the LAN.** The console's clock reads 2022, so TLS
 *   certificate validation would fail on anything served over HTTPS. The URL
 *   points at Home Assistant on the local network and never leaves it.
 * * **Playback happens here, not in the WebView.** The HUD's Chromium is a 2020
 *   build behind a `file://` origin; the page is for pixels, the platform media
 *   stack is for sound.
