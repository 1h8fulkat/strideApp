     * Belt speed in km/h.
     *
     * `ActualKph` (field 16) reads 0.00 on this board at every speed. It is not
     * a framing bug — `ActualIncline` decodes correctly from the two bytes
     * immediately after it, a bare single-field read of it returns the expected
     * 7-byte frame, and devices 2 and 65 answer the same way. The board simply
     * never fills it in.
     *
     * `Distance` *is* live and truthful though, so the belt tells us its speed
     * whether or not the firmware will say so.
     *
     * **What was wrong with reading it straight off the odometer.** Distance
     * arrives in whole metres, which is far too coarse to differentiate between
     * two polls, so it used to be differentiated across a four-second window.
     * That window is the bug. It reports the average of the last four seconds,
     * so the instant the pace changes the number is describing the pace you
     * *were* walking, and the whole-metre quantisation puts about ±0.5 km/h of
     * hash on top of it. A settle band hid all of that at a steady pace by
     * switching the readout over to the commanded speed — which meant the
     * moment you pressed a button the readout dropped out of the band, stopped
     * showing 6.0 and started showing the four-second average with the hash
     * back on it. Reported from the belt as "6 to 4.5 and then it slowly
     * settles", repeatedly, and quite right.
     *
     * **What it does instead.** Two halves that fail in opposite directions:
     *
     *  * [modelKph] — the belt chasing the commanded pace at a bounded rate.
     *    Instant and smooth, and wrong whenever the belt does not obey.
     *  * [trimKph] — the difference the odometer has actually accumulated,
     *    integrated slowly. Late and coarse, and the only thing here that has
     *    measured any real ground.
     *
     * The model carries the change, so pressing 7 at 6 km/h climbs from 6 to 7
     * and stops there. The trim carries the truth, so a belt that will not
     * reach 7 is shown at what it is doing within about ten seconds, and a
     * treadmill unplugged from its motor reads zero however hard the console
     * asks for 7. Neither half alone is honest; the readout is the sum.
     *
     * Returns null when there is no walk in progress.
