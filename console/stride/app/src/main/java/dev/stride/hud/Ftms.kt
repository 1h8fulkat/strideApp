/**
 * The treadmill, as a standard Bluetooth fitness machine.
 *
 * Zwift, Kinomap and the rest do not know what a NordicTrack is. What they know
 * is FTMS, the Bluetooth SIG's Fitness Machine Service, and a machine speaking
 * it turns up in their device list next to the commercial ones. This publishes
 * that service so the console can be paired with directly, with no phone in the
 * middle and nothing installed anywhere else.
 *
 * **Why this can exist at all.** Being found by Zwift means being a BLE
 * *peripheral*, and a peripheral has to advertise. Plenty of cheap MediaTek
 * parts can only be a central, which is the role [HeartRate] already uses for
 * the strap, and on one of those this file would be dead code. This console
 * answers `isMultipleAdvertisementSupported = true`, on the same mt8163 Argon
 * silicon that ciarancoffey/nordictrack-ftms-bridge runs on. That project is
 * where the idea came from and is credited in the README. It is AGPL and this
 * is Apache-2.0, so nothing was taken from it: the encoding below is the
 * published FTMS spec, and the field order is the spec's order because the
 * spec says it is normative.
 *
 * **Telemetry only, on purpose.** FTMS also defines a Control Point that lets
 * the app on the other end set speed and incline. It is deliberately not here.
 * The rule the whole guided walk is built on is that nothing sets the belt
 * speed except the person standing on the belt (see MainActivity's setSpeed),
 * and handing that to software on another device, in another room, is a
 * different decision that nobody has asked for yet. Reading is safe. Driving
 * is not the same thing.
