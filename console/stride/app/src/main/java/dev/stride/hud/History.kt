/**
 * Every walk this console has recorded, per walker, kept on the console.
 *
 * **Why this is on the treadmill and not in Home Assistant.** The summary screen
 * is the one place a walk gets looked at, and it is looked at while standing on
 * the belt, three seconds after stopping. Anything it needs has to be there with
 * no broker, no phone and no network — the same rule the rest of the console
 * follows. Home Assistant still gets every session over MQTT and still keeps the
 * long-term picture; this is the copy that makes "most climb you have done"
 * answerable when the wifi is out.
 *
 * It is also, incidentally, the first workout log the console has ever kept. Up
 * to 17 August 2026 the only thing it persisted was the route cache, so a walk
 * that was not published to HA left no trace anywhere once the ring buffer
 * rolled — which is exactly what happened to the first thirty-five minutes of
 * that day's session.
 *
 * **Guests are not recorded.** A walk with no profile has nobody to compare it
 * to and nobody who has agreed to be remembered, so it is summarised and then
 * forgotten. See [record].
