     * A release build is what belongs on a treadmill.
     *
     * A debug build carries `android:debuggable="true"`, which lets anything
     * else on the console attach to this process and read its store — the
     * broker password included — and it is what turns on the WebView DevTools
     * socket in MainActivity. Neither is a risk worth taking for a machine
     * that sits in a hallway for years.
     *
     * The signing key is yours and is never in this repo. Generate one:
     *
     *     keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/stride-release.jks -alias stride \
     *             -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
     *
     * then name it in local.properties, alongside the broker credentials:
     *
     *     stride.keystore=/Users/you/stride-release.jks
     *     stride.keystore.password=...
     *     stride.key.alias=stride
     *     stride.key.password=...
     *
     * Without those the release variant gets no signing config at all, and
     * Gradle produces an unsigned APK that adb refuses to install. That is the
     * correct failure: it names what is missing, where a build that quietly
     * fell back to the debug key would ship the thing we are avoiding.
