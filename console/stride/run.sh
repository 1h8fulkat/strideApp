# WebView DevTools socket. Fine on a bench, not what you want left in a
# hallway. So: if local.properties names a keystore, this builds release; if
# it does not, it builds debug and says so rather than asking you to set up
# signing before you can see your treadmill work. See app/build.gradle.kts for
# the four properties, and the keytool line that makes the key.
