# setprop is NOT proof that Wi-Fi ADB is about to disappear: on the console
# this was developed against it comes back after a power cycle regardless,
# without the persist property ever being set. Some builds restore it
# themselves. Rather than assert which yours is, this says what is true and
# tells you the one command that fixes it if yours forgets.

  NOTE: could not pin ADB over Wi-Fi with a property (this usually needs root).
  Many consoles bring it back after a power cycle anyway — check that yours
  does, because on a console built into a treadmill there is usually no USB
  port to fall back on, and Wi-Fi ADB is the only way in.

  Leave USB debugging enabled in Developer Options. That is the switch that
  would lock you out.

  The treadmill itself is fine either way: STRIDE comes back on its own. This
  is only about your remote access to it.
